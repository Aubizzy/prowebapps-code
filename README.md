# Pro Android Web Apps

This is an in-progress reorgnanisation of the [Pro Android Web Apps](http://apress.com/book/view/1430232765) book source code so that it can move towards being able to standalone and evolve, despite the words on the page being frozen in time.

__NOTE:__ The original source code for the book has been preserved at the **[at-print](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/prowebapps-code/tree/at-print)** branch and can be referenced there.

## Suggestions and Feedback

While the [at-print](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/prowebapps-code/tree/at-print) branch represents what was printed with the book and will remain static, this branch can evolve in response to your [suggestions](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/prowebapps-code/issues).  Obviously we can't please everyone, but we try and get it right for most.

## Motivation

Why am I doing this?  Quite simply because writing webapps for mobile is difficult.  It's even more difficult if you are trying to do it using a resource printed in 2011 when it's now 2013.

As such, I figured it was probably time that I did something about this.
