# Pro Android Web Apps

This is the source code that accompanies the Apress book, Pro Android Web Apps <http://apress.com/book/view/1430232765>, written by Damon Oehlman <http://twitter.com/DamonOehlman> and SÃ©bastien Blanc <http://twitter.com/sebi2706>.

If you have accessed this repository from the original links noted in the book please be aware that the primary source code location is now:

<https://github.com/DamonOehlman/prowebapps-code>

As this is a book on mobile web applications, the source code is primarily comprised of HTML, CSS and Javascript.  

Each of the chapters code samples are stored in the snippets directory, except in the cases where the sample code for that directory formed part of a larger exercise.  In these cases that chapter points to the location of the source so it can be referenced easily.

## Versioning

The code contained within this branch `at-print` is in line with the references made in the book as it was printed originally in 2011.

Additionally, I have recently started looking at bringing the code up-to-date with current versions of the frameworks referenced in the book and also perhaps organising the code better to assist readers as I've received feedback that it is hard to follow.

This work will happen in the [master](/https://github.com/DamonOehlman/prowebapps-code/tree/master) branch of this repository.
