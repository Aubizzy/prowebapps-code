# Pro Android Web Apps

This is an in-progress reorgnanisation of the [Pro Android Web Apps](http://apress.com/book/view/1430232765) book source code so that it can move towards being able to standalone and evolve, despite the words on the page being frozen in time.

The original source code for the book has been preserved at the [at-print](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/prowebapps-code/tree/at-print) branch and can be referenced there.

## Suggestions and Feedback

While the [at-print](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/prowebapps-code/tree/at-print) branch represents what was printed with the book and will remain static, this branch can evolve in response to your [suggestions](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/prowebapps-code/issues).  Obviously we can't please everyone, but we try and get it right for most.

## Motivation

Why am I doing this?  Quite simply because writing webapps for mobile is difficult.  It's even more difficult if you are trying to do it using a resource printed in 2011 when it's now 2013.
